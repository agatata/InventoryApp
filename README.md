# InventoryApp

App description Inventory App made for a fictional shop. This app was made for the Android Basics Nanodegree, as part of the Google Developer Challenge by Google and Udacity.

The app creates a SQLite database and with the help of a contract, a cursor loader and a database helper, it enables users to perform CRUD (Create - Read - Update - Delete) actions. App users can easily add products to the database, edit existing items, ordering from a supplier via a phone call or an e-mail, adding photos and delete products. Data validation is in place checking for empty fields.

Built With Android Studio XML Java UI design made with Sketch, following the Material Design guidelines
